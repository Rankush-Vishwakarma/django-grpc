Day 3: Traffic Purchase and Reward Sharing
Goal: Learn the Traffic purchase and reward sharing processes.
Exercise:
  Write a Python script to simulate the Traffic purchase process:
  Fetch the current Traffic balance.
  Calculate the delta between the threshold and the current balance.
  Log the purchase in a dummy database table.


Practice Task:
Modify the script to include reward sharing:
Calculate rewards based on the current round.
Log the rewards in a dummy tenant_rewards table.


Traffic Purchase:
  Users can purchase bandwidth (Traffic) in bytes for their validator nodes.
  Traffic is priced in USD but paid in Canton Coins (CC).
  The system ensures that users maintain a Traffic threshold to avoid disruptions.
Rewards:
  Users earn rewards in Canton Coins (CC) every 10 minutes for their participation.
  Rewards are calculated based on the user's activity, Traffic usage, and license status.
  Rewards are shared back to tenants after deducting fees and maintaining reserves.

Traffic Purchase:
  The system monitors the user's current Traffic balance.
  If the balance falls below the threshold, Traffic is purchased automatically.
  The purchase amount is logged in the tenant_Traffic_purchase_history table.
Reward Sharing:
  Rewards are calculated every 10 minutes.
  A portion of the rewards is shared with tenants based on their activity.
  Rewards are logged in the tenant_rewards table.
